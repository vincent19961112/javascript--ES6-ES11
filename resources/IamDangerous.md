At first I was afraid, I was afraid
Down in the darkness I was crawling through the human race
I heard the voices through the dark
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
So I beat my fist against my chest, against my heart
Hey-ho!
Hear the sound
We are the underground
Hey-ho!
Rising up
We're not afraid of fighting
I've finally found my place
I put the war paint on my face
And I'm ready to give (Hey!)
Whatever it takes
Standing at the edge of the fire
Fighting for the will to survive
I feel it burning under my skin
And I'm back on my feet again
This is the feeling
I can't believe it
My heart is bleeding out
Now I'm dangerous
Feeding the fire
Higher and higher
Rising up, rising up
Now I'm dangerous
Silence the voices in my head
I picked my poison now, I'll drink it to the bitter end
Hey-ho! Hear me now!
I take on the darkness by myself
'Cause I'm ready to give (Hey!)
Whatever it takes
Standing at the edge of the fire
I don't know how I ever survived
I feel it burning under my skin
And now I'm back on my feet again
This is the feeling
I can't believe it
My heart is bleeding out
Now I'm dangerous
Feeding the fire
Higher and higher
Rising up, rising up
Now I'm dangerous
This is the feeling
I can't believe it
My heart is bleeding out
Now I'm dangerous
Feeding the fire
Higher and higher
Rising up, rising up
Now I'm dangerous
I'm dangerous!
Rising up, rising up
Now I'm dangerous
