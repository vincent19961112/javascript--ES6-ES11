I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
And I miss that
Oh
Don't wanna talk about it
Oooh
I was so wrong about it
Oooh
Can't do a thing about it now
Now
'Cause they say if you love her let her go
And they say if it's meant to be you'll know
Know
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
And I miss that
Yeah
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
I miss that
I miss that
I miss that
I miss that
I miss that
I miss that
Ohhh
Don't wanna talk about it
Oooh
I was so wrong about it
Oooh
Can't do a thing about it now
Now
Ohhh
Don't wanna talk about it
Oooh
I was so wrong about it
Oooh
Can't do a thing about it now
Now
And they say if it's meant to be you'll know
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
Damn, I miss that
