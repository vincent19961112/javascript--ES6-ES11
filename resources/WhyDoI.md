Messing with my head again
You had your heart set on me
But these feelings, they come and go
And they come so easily
Tell me, what
It is about you that I can't forget?
But you're breaking down my walls again
Just to set me free
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the way you only always leave me?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the touch but never love the feeling?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the way you only always leave me?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the touch but never love the feeling?
Staying up when I go out
You gotta know I'm all yours
But when I say, "What's that about?"
You start slurring your words
Tell me, why you have to seem
So distant when I'm holding you?
Your fingertips are drifting away
And I fucking love how it hurts
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the way you only always leave me?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the touch but never love the feeling?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the way you only always leave me?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the touch but never love the feeling?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Why do I, baby? Why do I?
Love the touch but never love the feeling?
